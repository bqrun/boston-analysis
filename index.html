          Reproducing Past Analyses
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            See <a href="http://boston-qualifier-stats.blogspot.com/">http://boston-qualifier-stats.blogspot.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.namethatbostonmarathoncutoff.com/">http://www.namethatbostonmarathoncutoff.com/</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, I tried to reproduce these analyses as closely as possible. The methodology is described in detail <a href="http://boston-qualifier-stats.blogspot.com/p/objective-and-methodology.html">here</a>.
            <br/>
            The basic idea is as follow:
            <ol>
              <li>Get all the finisher data for the top 25 "feeder" marathons (I'm actually using the top 25 for each of the past 3 years)</li>
              <li>Count how many finishers from last year met the designated cutoff (2015: 62s, 2016: 147s)</li>
              <li>Call this number <i>n</i></li>
              <li>For the current year, order finishers in decreasing order by the margin (in seconds) with which they qualified</li>
              <li>Count down to the finisher with the <i>n</i>th largest margin</li>
              <li>This person's margin is the estimated cutoff</li>
            </ol>
            There are a number of assumptions for this model to be accurate, including all years must have equivalent
            (1) Boston field size,
            (2) Total number of qualifiers,
            (3) Contribution to Boston from <i>these</i> feeder races,
            and (4) Likelihood of any given qualifier registering for Boston.
            <br/>
            Anyhow, this is what I got:
            <br/>
            <h4>Q2016 Analysis</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>2015 cutoff: 62 seconds</li>
              <li>For 2015, 41,236 people met the cutoff.</li>
              <!--<li>For 2016, 43,180 people met the same cutoff.</li>-->
              <li>For 2016, 41,236 people met a cutoff of 111 seconds.</li>
              <li>Actual 2016 cutoff: 147 seconds</li>
            </ul>
            This estimate is (1) not very close to the actual cutoff of 147 seconds and (2) only pretty close to
            the <a href="http://boston-qualifier-stats.blogspot.com/2015/09/final-projected-boston-marathon-2016.html">original posted estimate</a>
            of 91 seconds. In this previous analysis, she added the caveat that without the "outlier", Berlin, the prediction was 130 seconds.
            It's not clear why my estimate using the same method is so different. There are obviously differences in the minutia
            of scraping, parsing, what to do with some types of missing data, etc, that introduced a bit of variation. 
            <br/>
            <h4>Q2017 Analysis</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>2016 cutoff: 147 seconds</li>
              <li>For 2016, 39,768 people met the cutoff.</li>
              <!-- For 2017, 35,647 met the same cutoff. -->
              <li>For 2017, 39,768 met a cutoff of 59 seconds.</li>
            </ul>
            I'm using more data here than the <a href="http://www.namethatbostonmarathoncutoff.com/2016/03/2015-philadelphia-marathon-cutoff-update.html">existing analysis</a>,
            so the numbers aren't directly comparable, but my previous estimates using the same subset of races were largely consistent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another analysis reproducing last year's method can be found at <a href="http://community.runnersworld.com/topic/bq-for-2017-analysis">http://community.runnersworld.com/topic/bq-for-2017-analysis</a>. The results up through Ottawa are about halfway down <a href="http://community.runnersworld.com/topic/bq-for-2017-analysis?page=9">page 9</a>, but it hasn't been since.

          The Complicated Way
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            I wanted to come up with a better way. Most notably, I want to avoid caveats and ignoring individual races (ex. Berlin)
            by explicitly modeling the relative contributions of each race. I have also run the analysis over past years so that we
            can actually estimate its accuracy and hopefully improve over the more straightforward analyses above. Here it is. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Importantly, I'm also using a slightly different definition of "qualifier" than the previous analysis. Most everyone
            reports only those who met the qualifying time for their <i>current</i> age when they ran the qualifying race. In
            reality, one need only meet the qualifying standard for the age they will be when they run Boston. To approach this
            number, particularly when I'm trying to figure out which qualifiers actually ran Boston, I allow each finisher to age
            up to 2 years, accounting for many races run the better part of 2 years before the Boston for which they qualify.
            For this reason, the number of qualifiers used and shown below will be a little higher across the board than other
            numbers out there. In the above analysis, this change makes very little difference, but it will impact the registration
            rates I use below.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are the top 25 marathons contributing runners to Boston any time between 2015 and 2017 (30 total).
            Those in <span style='color:red'>red</span> are qualifiers for the 2017 Boston marathon.

            I built an estimate of the proportion of qualifiers from each race that actually runs Boston by comparing names and
            ages with the published Boston results. This matching is not perfect, but it's close. These values illustrate why
            Berlin is an outlier - because ~6% of qualifiers register for Boston, compared to ~40% in North America. Each qualifier is
            given a weight according to the likelihood of their registering for Boston, then a number of people is chosen, accounting
            for changes in the field size. Here's all the data:

          <p>
            So, to estimate a cutoff, I sort all finishers in decreasing order by qualification margin and give each
            a weight equal to the registration rate for their qualifying race. I then run a cumulative sum down the list
            until the total is equal to the number of finishers who ran Boston from these races last year. This person's
            margin represents the predicted cutoff and takes into account registration rate variability between races.
            If this same method was applied last year, the prediction would have been 138 seconds - not quite 147, but
            noticeably closer than 91.
          </p>

          <h4>Boston Marathon 2017 cutoff prediction: -42 seconds, or NO CUTOFF!</h4>
          <h4><span style='color:red; font-weight:bold'>UPDATED</span>, keep reading...</h4>

          <p>
            From a practical point of view, this is largely because the Boston marathon itself contributes a huge number
            of qualifiers and has a relatively high registration rate, so this year's rather hot and slow Boston marathon
            dramatically reduced the expected cutoff.

            The above analysis reduced our original assumptions by exactly one. In reality, there is also unaccounted-for
            variation in the registration rate per race <i>over time</i> and last year's number of Boston runners is not
            always an accurate proxy for this year's number of runners from these races. The proportion of the Boston field
            made up of runners from these top 25 races is not constant and varies according to both the number and speed of
            qualifiers from these races, and the many smaller qualifying races.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's the registration rate for the analyzed races over the past 5 years:

            These show some global year-by-year variation, but no long term trend.

          <p>
            This shows that, in addition to the registration rate among these races not being constant, the proportion of registering
            qualifiers from <i>these</i> races relative to <i>all</i> races is not constant. These percentages are out of the entire
            Boston field, not just those reserved for qualifiers (typically, ~80%). Further analyses using the % of field may have to
            take this into account.

            It's clear that the average speed of qualifiers from these races was lowest for 2013 and this year,
            reflecting, most likely, unseasonably warm temperatures at Boston in 2012 and 2016. Qualifying times were
            much better for 2015 and 2016. Qualification <i>at</i> Boston for the next year seems to be a strong driver
            of the overall qualification rate and cutoff time since it shows unusually high variability and contributes
            a huge proportion of the field.

            I've had many question about how the seemingly high registration rate so far (after the 1st week) might affect the cutoff.
            Below are plots of the margins of Boston runners and the average registration rate by qualifying margin year over year.
            Note that, yes, the registration rate is significantly higher among those with smaller qualifying margins.
            Interestingly, there is a significant registration rate among those who <i>don't</i> meet the cutoff for a given year.
            This must be because they 1) ran another qualifying race with a faster time - they'd be counted twice in my analysis,
            or 2) my method for matching names of qualifiers to Boston runners is producing a bunch of false positive matches.

            But what does it mean!? It means that the registration rate for the 0-5 min group is, on average, 46% (for those who meet the cutoff), while the registration rate among
            5+ min qualifiers is only 32%. We'll assume that this <i>relative</i> rate of registration between 5+ and &lt;5 min qualifiers remains the same.
            Let's do some math:

            <pre>
5+ min qualifiers (Q2017): 31,597
5+ min registrants (Q2017): 17,484
5+ min registration rate (Q2016): 0.3231

&lt;5 min qualifiers (Q2017): 10,122
&lt;5 min registration rate (Q2016): 0.4642

17,484 / 31,597 = 0.5533              observed 5+ registrants / observed qualifiers (Q2017)
0.5533 * (0.4642 / 0.3231) = 0.7950   expected &lt;5 registrants / observed qualifiers (Q2017)
10,122 * 0.7950 = 8,047               expected &lt;5 min registrants (Q2017)

(30,000 * 0.8) - 17,484 - 8,047 = -1,531    expected field size (for qualifiers)
                                            - real and expected registrants

1,531 / 0.7950 = 1,926                      estimated excess qualifiers
            </pre>

            This is probably too many. 17,484 + 8,047 = 25,531 registrants, which is over 85% of the field. 80% of the field of 30,000 would be 24,000.
            To get to 24,000, we can count down the field 1,531 expected registrants, equivalent to 1,531 / 0.7950 = 1,926 qualifiers on our list.
            The bottom 1,926 qualifiers come up to a margin of <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">53 seconds</span>.
            Obviously, this is noticeably different (and worse) than the 0 (or -42) seconds I was estimating before registration started.

          <p>
            Why did he mislead us? Why did he give us false hope and now he's taking it away?
            Because the registration rate among qualifiers does not follow a predictable pattern.
            This was one of our assumptions way back at the beginning. I showed way above (the first plot) that the registration rate by race changes every year,
            but does not follow any noticeable pattern. Below is the overall registration rate (from these races) over the past 5 years, and the
            estimate given the registration so far this year. This indicates that either registration actually increased across the board,
            or the set of large feeder races we were using as a proxy for all races is not actually representative of all qualifiers.
            We know that a lot of these qualifiers were hot and slow (read: blocked by a train), so maybe these people went and qualified at smaller
            marathons. This is one of any number of plausible explanations for the failure of our initial model to predict the true registration rate.
          </p>

          <p>
            To get this estimate of the registration rate from the total for the 5+ min group (17,484), we have to do some tricky math since this is not directly
            comparable to either our qualifier set or the registration estimates based on the Boston <i>results</i> list. The 2016 5+ min registration rate was 0.3231.
            If this stayed the same for 2017, which we assumed, we would have expected to see 31,597 * 0.3231 = 10,209 registrants from this set of qualifiers,
            and 10,122 * 0.4642 = 4,698 registrants &lt;5 min. Last year, 27,488 of presumably 30,000 registrants ran, or 91.6%.
            So we would have observed 10,209 + 4,698 = 14,907 of (~24,000 * 0.916) registrants, or 67.8% of the field.
            This should have been a clue, since (as shown above somewhere), last year these same qualifiers made up only 53% of the field. If these qualifiers make up 67.8%
            of the field, then the effective registration rate from the qualifiers we observed was about (0.678 * 17,484 = 11,856) / 31,597 = 0.375. 
            This represents the highest registration rate over the 6 years I have data, and a 10.3% increase over last year - enough to account for over 2,000 excess
            registrants.

            We obviously missed at least one critical parameter. The most obvious, that we have the data to rectify, is the variance in registration rate
            by qualifying margin. As shown above, the closer your qualifying margin, the more likely you are to register. We have all of this data,
            so it's relatively easy to incorporate it into the model. Our new weighting criteria is as follows:
          </p>

          <pre>qualifer_weight = race_registration_rate * margin_registration_rate / average_registration_rate</pre>

          <p>
            We don't want to just compute the registration rate for every combination of race and margin, we just don't have the sampling power to do
            that without overfitting, hence we compound the two weight factors separately, then normalize by the average registration rate.
            If we go ahead and use this new weighting scheme to compute the cutoff as above, and with <i>no knowledge</i> of the registration rate so far
            this year, we get an estimated cutoff of <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">48 seconds</span>. This is consistent with our estimate of
            53 seconds knowing the 5+ registrants this year. Notably, this new model retroactively predicts the 2016 cutoff at 132 seconds, worse than 138, but still within
            striking distance of 147.
